                <h2>Hi,</h2>
                <p>I am a recent high school graduate with a major interest in web development and web technologies in general. I started developing client-side applications as I am more of a visual person and I like to see my progress as I am building the app. I am also a genuinely active person, from a young age, I have been playing ice hockey and it has been my hobby ever since. </p>
