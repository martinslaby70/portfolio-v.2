                <h2>Hi,</h2>
                <p>I am a recent high school graduate with a major interest in web development and web technologies in general. I started developing client-side applications as I am more of a visual person and I like to see my progress as I am building the app. </p>
                
                <div className={classes}>
                    <p>I am also a genuinely active person, from a young age, I have been playing ice hockey and it has been my hobby ever since. But I also enjoy just chatting with my friend and casually playing video games. </p>
                    <p>After elementary school, I wanted to turn my interest in games into something more productive. I was always more interested in game mechanics than the actual game content. I enjoyed finding bugs, technical glitches, and others, unintended mechanics.  These things lead me to study computer science. But alter on, I found out that game development inst for me. </p>
                    <p>But luckily I was tasked to create a website for an upcoming game that my classmates created. This small static HTML website was my first experience in web development. I truly hope I have made some progress since then  :) . In my opinion, when someone asks you how would you see yourself in two of five years. there isn't a good answer... I feel like I just want to be better than I was a month ago. </p>
