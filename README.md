### Cube effects
You can see changes in the background cube behavior, these changes depend on mouse movement. Specifically,
on hover on one of these elements

  - About me section _- reverse movement_
  - unavailable projects _- changes color to red_
  - menu  _- slows down_

### Projects    
 - At the time, I have only one fully working project, I have worked on many more, but they're either not 
worth showing or they are made using old technologies. 
 - Each project have a 'live demo' and 'code' button, witch redirect you to either GitHub repository or 
live demo hosted on vercel.com
 - Website responsivity is shown by an icon standing next to the project

### Theme
Using Sass I have created 2 different themes, color change is based on body class. Active theme is 
stored in local storage for better user experience

### Skills
You should be able to see the technologies that I am using from my projects alone. So in this section, 
I will only include technologies and software that help me in web development or benefits me in any other way.
- every item has a small sentence about how it helps me or why am I using it. This paragraph is visible on hover
of a requested software/technology
